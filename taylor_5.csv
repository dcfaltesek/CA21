"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace - Karaoke Version","Red",0.545,"And I said, ""I'm sorry, too"""
"Taylor Swift","State Of Grace - Karaoke Version","Red",0.545,"And that was the moment I knew"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"You said it in a simple way"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"4 AM, the second day"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"How strange that I don't know you at all"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Stumbled through the long goodbye"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"One last kiss, then catch your flight"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Right when I was just about to fall"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"I told myself, don't get attached"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"But in my mind, I play it back"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Spinning faster than the plane that took you"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"And this is when the feeling sinks in"

"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"The delicate beginning rush"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"The feeling you can know so much"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Without knowing anything at all"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"And now that I can put this down"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"If I had known what I know now"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"I never would've played so nonchalant"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Taxi cabs and busy streets"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"That never bring you back to me"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"I can't help but wish you took me with you"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"And this is when the feeling sinks in"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"I don't wanna miss you like this"

"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"This is falling in love in the cruelest way"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"This is falling for you when you are worlds away"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"In New York, be here"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"But you're in London, and I break down"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"'Cause it's not fair that you're not around"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"This is when the feeling sinks in"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"I don't wanna miss you like this"
"Taylor Swift","Red - Karaoke Version","Red",0.611,"Come back, be here, come back, be here"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And everybody knows that"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"I don't even know her"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"It's kinda like a code, yeah"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And you've been getting closer and closer"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And crossing so many lines"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And it would be a fine proposition"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"If I was a stupid girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"But, honey, I am no one's exception"

"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"You understand perfectly"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"You're the kind of man who makes me sad"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And take for granted what you have"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And it would be a fine proposition"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"If I was a stupid girl"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"And, yeah, I might go with it"
"Taylor Swift","Treacherous - Karaoke Version","Red",0.685,"If I hadn't once been just like her"
