This is the github site for NMC 245, Cultura Analytics and Data Science at Oregon State University. 

Dan Faltesek is the instructor for this course and this github includes custom instructional materials for the class, use them as you see fit, please let me know if you do (it is nice for expanded impact and such). 

While this page is great for downloading materials, all of your actual assignments and grading will be on the class canvas page.

You should integrate this page into your Oregon State RStudio cloud session:

file>new project>version control> git

Then copy the url for this repo into the spot for the link. You should pull at the start of class daily and you should regularly use your own strach files as well.
